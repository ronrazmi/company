# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 100.times do 

# Employee.create(first_name: Faker::Name.first_name, last_name: Faker::Name.last_name, title: Faker::Name.title, phone_number: Faker::PhoneNumber.phone_number, team: Faker::Team.name, university: Faker::University.name)

# end

# 200.times do
# 	Address.create(address_1: Faker::Address.street_address, address_2: Faker::Address.secondary_address, city: Faker::Address.city, state: Faker::Address.state, zip: Faker::Address.zip_code, employee_id: rand(1..100))
# end
